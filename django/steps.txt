Django – Design Philosophies
Django comes with the following design philosophies -

Loosely Coupled - Django aims to make each element of its stack independent of the others.

Less Coding - Less code so in turn a quick development.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) - Everything should be developed only in exactly one place instead of repeating it again and again.

Fast Development - Django's philosophy is to do all it can to facilitate hyper-fast development.

Clean Design - Django strictly maintains a clean design throughout its own code and makes it easy to follow best web-development practices.
