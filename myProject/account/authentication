Inbuild apps:
'django.contrib.auth'
'django.contrib.contenttypes'

Authentication support is bundled as a Django contrib module in django.contrib.auth.
By default, the required configuration is already included in the settings.py generated by django-admin startproject,
these consist of two items listed in your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

'django.contrib.auth' contains the core of the authentication framework, and its default models.
'django.contrib.contenttypes' is the Django content type system,
 which allows permissions to be associated with models you create.
and these items in your MIDDLEWARE setting:

SessionMiddleware manages sessions across requests.
AuthenticationMiddleware associates users with requests using sessions.
With these settings in place,
running the command manage.py migrate creates the necessary database tables for auth related models and permissions for any models defined in your installed apps.
